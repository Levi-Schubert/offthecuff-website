# NSS Capstone - Off the Cuff
Off the Cuff is the website for my podcast, which needs quite the overhaul to be brought into the modern era. It's currently entirely html and css. To update episodes an unstable python script is used to transfer new web files over ftp. The revamping of the website will include:
1. a dynamic single page application
1. user login, registration, and profiles
1. a forum to allow discussion
1. an admin only panel that allows addition of new episodes

## API ERD

## Planned Frameworks & Tools
1. react
1. bulma / bloomers (css)
1. firebase (login)
